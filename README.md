# ResharperTesting
A project to turn JetBrain's free [Resharper CLI Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/command-line.html) into a basic GUI.

## Background
This project exists because I don't want to pay for ReSharper myself, but I also don't want to use my company's JetBrains licenses for personal projects.
However, I also want the convenience of being able to autoformat my code like ReSharper or Rider allows me to.

Given that the clean functionality is available in free cli form but I don't necessarily want to add ResharperCLI as dependencies to my projects or mess around with the command line, I decided to make this tool.
